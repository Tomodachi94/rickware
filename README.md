# Tomodachi's Black Box

A black box that does something. I'm not entirely sure what, but it compiled...

Licensed under the CC0 because it is literally useless.

## Compiling

To compile, you'll need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). See specific instructions below.

### Compiling for the masses

If you aren't gonna develop on this:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Compiling for the developers

```sh
cargo build
```
until it works, then compile for the masses.
