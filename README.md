# RickWare

A program to rickroll people with.

Licensed under the CC0 because it is literally useless.

## Compiling

To compile, you'll need to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
Another tool, called [just](https://just.systems/man/en), will make your life significantly easier.

To compile for a new release, run `just build-release`. To compile for development purposes, run `just build-dev`.

Alternatively, see specific instructions below for compiling manually.

### Manually

#### Compiling for the masses

If you aren't gonna develop on this:
```sh
cargo build --release
```

#### Compiling for the developers

```sh
cargo build
```
until it works, then compile for the masses.
